> React Application created by create-react-app (Typescript) which includes Auth0

This sample demonstrates how to renew `access_token`s in a React application with Auth0 using `checkSession`. For more information, read [ reference documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/auth0js#using-checksession-to-acquire-new-tokens). The sample uses the create-react-app.

## Getting Started

Create a new API in the [APIs section](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis) and provide an identifier for it.

Clone the repo or download it from the React quickstart page in Auth0's documentation. Install create-react-app and the dependencies for the app.

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
cd react-auth0-typescript
npm install
```

## Set the Client ID, Domain, and API URL

If you download the sample from the quickstart page, it will come pre-populated with the **client ID** and **domain** for your application. If you clone the repo directly from Github, rename the `auth0-variables.tsx.example` file to `auth0-variables.tsx` and provide the **client ID** and **domain** there. This file is located in `src/Auth/`.

## Set Up `Allowed Web Origins` in the dashboard

In order to make `checkSession` work, you need to add the URL where the authorization request originates from, to the Allowed Web Origins list of your Auth0 client in the Dashboard under your client's Settings.

## Set up any Identity Providers

In order to log in with Google, Facebook, etc. you'll have to connect them as [Identity Providers](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders) to Auth0. Follow those instructions for each provider you'll be using.

Note that you'll still be able to log in to the app without setting this up, but you'll be using the Auth0 dev keys. The 'Renew Token' button won't work.

## Run the Application

The development server that comes with create-react-app can be used to serve the application.

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be served at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Troubleshooting

If you see an error on renewal saying `login_required`, that means you may be using the Auth0 dev keys for whichever social login you're testing. You'll need to add your own keys for this to work.

## Run the Application With Docker

In order to run the example with docker you need to have `docker` installed.

You also need to set the environment variables as explained [previously](#set-the-client-id-domain-and-api-url).

Execute in command line `sh exec.sh` to run the Docker in Linux, or `.\exec.ps1` to run the Docker in Windows.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
